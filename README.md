# xorCrypt
xorCrypt is a simple program that acts on two files of the same size and xors the second with the first. This allows for simple encryption. If only one file is provided then a new file is created, of the same length of passed file.

xorCrypt takes two files as an input. The first file is the key, the second is the data file. The key and the datafile are the same size. A key is generated for a datafile if no key is given (one argument is passed).
